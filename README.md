# House-Price-Prediction-Lahore-Using-Data-Science-Machine-Learning

we are going to build a machine learning model which will predict price of a house in lahore.<br>
We have collected the data set.<br>
We have preprocessed the data set by performing:<br>
- Cleaning<br>
- Wrangling<br>
- Encoding<br>
- Normalization<br>
- PCS<br>
- Visualization(through Univariate ,Bivariate analysis,heatmap and correlation matrix )<br>
- Descriptive analysis<br>
# Model
We used Regression model and following to see its accuracy :
## R-squared (R2):

 - Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable <br>from the independent variables.
 - Ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit
## Mean Absolute Error (MAE):

 - Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
 - Easy to understand and interpret.
## Mean Squared Error (MSE):

 - Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
 - Puts more emphasis on large errors.
## Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):

 - The square root of MSE, providing a similar interpretation but in the original unit of the target variable.
 - More sensitive to large errors compared to MSE.
